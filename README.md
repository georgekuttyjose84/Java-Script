# 🌟 About This Repository

This repository is a personal collection of **simple and beginner-friendly JavaScript projects** that I am building to improve my understanding of JavaScript and strengthen my programming foundation.

My goal with this repo is to **learn by building**, explore core JavaScript concepts, and slowly grow a clean portfolio of practical mini-projects.  
Each project focuses on one main idea such as DOM manipulation, event handling, basic logic building, or UI interactions.

Every project is placed inside its own folder and contains:

- `index.html` — the main webpage
- `styles.css` / `style.css` — the visual design
- `script.js` — the JavaScript functionality

I started this repository to keep my learning organized, track my progress, and continue improving step-by-step as I build more projects.
