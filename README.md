# JavaScript Projects

This repository contains basic JavaScript projects that I am building to improve my skills and understand core JavaScript concepts.

Each project has its own folder with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## 🚀 Projects Included
- Beginner-level JavaScript programs
- Simple DOM manipulation projects
- Small utilities and mini apps

More projects will be added soon as I continue learning and practicing JavaScript.
