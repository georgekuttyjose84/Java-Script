# JavaScript Mini Projects Collection

![Repo Banner](./assets/banner.png)

> A personal collection of small, beginner-friendly JavaScript projects focused on learning core concepts through hands-on building.

## 🌟 About This Repository

This repository contains a set of small JavaScript projects I built to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, basic algorithms, and UI interaction. Each project is self-contained inside its own folder and includes a simple HTML/CSS/JS structure so you can open and run each project immediately.

**Goal:** Learn by building — develop a clean portfolio of practical mini-projects and improve JavaScript fundamentals one project at a time.

Each project folder typically contains:

* `index.html` — the main webpage for the project
* `styles.css` or `style.css` — styles for the project
* `script.js` — JavaScript file containing the project logic

## ✅ Contributing

Contributions and improvements are welcome! A few suggestions:

* Add comments and documentation to JavaScript files for readability.
* Improve styling and responsive behavior in CSS.
* Add tests or validation where appropriate (e.g., input validation for calculators).
* Create new mini-projects and follow the same folder structure.

If you'd like to contribute, open a PR describing the change.
