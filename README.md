# JavaScript Projects

This repository contains simple JavaScript projects that I am building to improve my skills and understand core JavaScript concepts.

Each project has its own folder with `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.

## 🚀 Projects Included

A simple JavaScript quiz application that displays questions, collects user answers, and evaluates the score.
